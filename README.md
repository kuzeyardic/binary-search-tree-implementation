# binary-search-tree-implementation with following methods without using library 

BST: Constructor. Reads the integer keys of the array one by one, and inserts them into the binary search tree one by one. You can assume that there are no identical keys in the array.
insertKey: Inserts a key to the BST, if it does not exist in the BST before.
deleteKey: Deletes a key from the BST, if it exists in the BST.
displayInorder: Displays an inorder traversal of the BST.
findFullBTLevel: Finds the maximum level at which the tree is a full binary tree, and displays the level number. Assume that root is level 1 in all the level related questions.
lowestCommonAncestor: Finds the common Ancestor of keys A and B that has the highest level. Assume that a node A is the ancestor of itself.
maximumSumPath: Finds the path from root to a leaf node which has the maximum sum of the keys included in the path, and displays the keys of the path from its root to the leaf. You can assume that there is only one path with the maximum Sum path in the tree.
maximumWidth: Finds the level of the tree which has the maximum number of nodes and displays its keys from left to right. In case of multiple maximum widths select the lowest level.
pathFromAtoB: Finds the path from key A to key B, and displays the keys included in the path.
